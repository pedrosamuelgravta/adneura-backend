                Create 3 very distinct and relevant message triggers for each {strategic_goals}.
                Pinpoint specific life events, emotions, or circumstances that move this audience towards the brand goals. These could range from seasonal needs to personal milestones.

                For each trigger, describe the trigger and how it will motivate the specific audience.
                Create an amazing title for it with one or two main words.
                Imporant, if the trigger of one audience is the same of another audience use the exactly same name to keep consistency. If they are similar, but the motiffs are different, use different names.
                Create a scene description that best describes each trigger.
                Also, bring the scene in prompt format to be used in a text to image GenAI.

                For each trigger, follow this exact structure:


                Title: [Trigger Title]
                Description: [1 paragraph summarizing the message trigger]
                Core Idea: [1 paragraph describing the core idea behind the message trigger]
                Narrative Hook: [1 paragraph describing how the brand, service or product is part of the audience routine]
                Why it Works: [1 paragraph explaining why this message trigger will work with this audience]
                Goal: [pick the most appropriate goal_name from the list above and output **only** that exact goal_name string]
                Campaign Name: [output exactly the campaign_name string from the current strategic_goals object]
                Image Prompt: [generate a prompt to be used in text to image GenAI to create a scene that best describes the message trigger. Make sure it represents the trigger and its target audience. Generate a detailed image and include the best product, service or brand best fit for the audience]
